# Database for Discbro
Here is the docuemntation for the database. This file explains how it is set up, how it is used and why the desiscions that were made, were made.

## Tables
### Users
The "users" table contains 4 datapoints:
- id: A uniqe id for each user.
This id is used to refer to the user in the server. For example: if the user adds another user as a friend, and both accept, it is stored in
the "friends" table as (id, user1, user2), where user1 and user2 are user id's. This number starts at 10000 and counts up.

- username: The username of this account. Displayed as "@username", is can only contain lowercase letters a - z, and numbers 0 - 9.
The username can NOT change. This is mainly used by the users to locate their friends on the app and add them as freinds.

- displayname: The name displayed in most areas of the app, for this account. This dispayname can contain any letter / character the user wishes to use.
This is mainly costemtic, but also what will be seen most places in the app.

- password: This contains the hash generated by the users password, A.K.A their password. 60 characters long, since bcrypt's hashes are 60 characters long.
When the user is created, the password is converted to a hash with 10 salt rounds. After the user is created, the password is discarded and whenever the user tries to log in, the password in the request is compared to the hash.
